  - Warning alerts: Dark amber text (#664d03)

## Accessibility Standards Met

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: All text now meets minimum contrast ratios
- **Color Contrast**: Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text
- **Consistent Styling**: Unified color scheme across all components

## Browser Compatibility

These improvements work across all modern browsers:
- Chrome/Chromium
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Dark Mode Support

The application also includes dark mode support for users who prefer it:
- Automatically detects system preference
- Maintains proper contrast in both light and dark modes
- Smooth transitions between modes

## Testing

To test the contrast improvements:
1. Visit the application homepage
2. Register/login to access the dashboard
3. Check readability of:
   - Alert messages
   - Card content
   - List items
   - Code blocks
   - Form elements
   - Tables

All text should now be clearly readable on white backgrounds with no visibility issues.
